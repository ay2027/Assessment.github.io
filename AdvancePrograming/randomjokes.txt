What did the shark say when he ate the clownfish?
What is orange and sounds like a carrot?
What do you call a woman with one leg?
Why did the frog take the bus to work today?
What is an astronaut favorite part on a computer?
What do you call an apology written in dots and dashes?
Why do not the circus lions eat the clowns?
Why do French people eat snails?
